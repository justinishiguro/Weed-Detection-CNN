# Weed-Detection-CNN

This is a base model Convolutional Neural Network for weed detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow. 

Since this is our base model, we trained our model on this [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/crop-and-weed-detection-data-with-bounding-boxes) dataset consisting of 1300 images.

We achieved an accuracy of 93.9%, however are in the process of creating a custom dataset of 6500+ weed and plant images, so we can create more reasonable train and test splits.
