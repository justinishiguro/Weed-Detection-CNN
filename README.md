# Weed-Detection-CNN

This is a base model Convolutional Neural Network for weed detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow. 

We created a custom dataset of 6500+ weeds and plants from two pre-existing datasets: (https://weed-ai.sydney.edu.au/datasets/2c14915b-0827-4b65-9908-d2a6df0d48f3) and (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/crop-and-weed-detection-data-with-bounding-boxes)
